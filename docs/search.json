For the EDSS index, the missing values that correspond to the Controls are filled in with the zero value. However, as per team info, EDSS was used to derive the target grouping for disease severity, hence it is not used in the analysis as a potential predictor. A few Controls cases have a non-zero value of 1 or 2 i.e. low index. These are cases that were initially grouped as CIS but then changed grouping to Controls by the medical team.\n\nChanges after data are imported:\n\nTo make disease severity group comparison fair and possible, 42 columns were removed from the data. These columns do not contain values in all 3 disease severity groups of Control, CIS and MS, and they are mostly lipid related, but also containing the following clinical metadata columns: Brain_MRI_Lesions, Spinal_MRI_T2W and Spinal_MRI_Lesions.\nMissing values in lipid concentrations correspond to non detected values which can naturally occur during LC/MS processing. These have been substituted with the value of 1 such that when the log transformation is applied they become zero to denote non-detection.",

Currently, only the lipid with code name lip1012 has been identified as SM_42:2_. Below, three models have been built upon the base one and utilizing the above lipids in different ways:\n\nA penalized ordinal regression model that includes nonlinear and interaction terms amongst all variables Age, Albumin_CSF, lip1172, lip156 and lip1012, with 8.8 degrees of freedom and with a backward elimination procedure applied to it. The final resulting model included only the variables Age, Albumin_CSF, lip1172 and lip1012.\nA penalized ordinal regression model that includes all variables Age, Albumin_CSF, lip1172, lip156 and lip1012 in a nonlinear form and with 7.5 degrees of freedom.\nAn ordinal regression model that includes Age, Albumin_CSF, and lip1012 all in a nonlinear form and with 6 degrees of freedom.\n\nBelow a table of performance metrics as well as calibration plots are shown for all of these models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel_id\ndf\nC_index\nvariation_type\nmodel_type\nvariables\n\n\n\n\n1\n8.8\n0.78\nsampling & 46 terms\npenalized\n4\n\n\n2\n7.5\n0.81\nsampling\npenalized\n5\n\n\n3\n6.0\n0.76\nsampling & 6 terms\nunpenalized\n3",

The x-axis indicates the risk event probability. The model appears well calibrated. For predicting MS (when at Control or CIS stage), there is good performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo note, model 1 is also taking into account that lipids lip1172 and lip156 have a Pearson correlation of ~93%, and from two lipids it has selected lip1172. However, since backward elimination does not perform well in the presence of collinearity, model 1 feature selection should be considered with a grain of salt.\nModel 3 has the best calibration and mean absolute error mae performance even though its C-index is not the highest among the three models. It only spends though 6 degrees of freedom df and achieves a C-index not far from the other two models, having therefore a good balance between parsimony and predictive power. Being the less complex model is also desirable since more room is left for potential new lipids to be added to the model from the results of a correlation network analysis.\n\n\nA couple of interesting observations for this study are: 1) Identification of significant lipids after adjustment for clinical information can detect lipids that are in addition correlated to each other, and 2) In the pool of significant lipids that have been obtained, the most significant lipid as per its chisq statistic or FDR adjusted p-value i.e. here lip1172, does not necessarily give the best model when compared to models involving the less significant lipids i.e. here SM_42:2_ aka lip1012.",

lipids in a non linear form of association with the MS disease severity. First a correlation plot is shown below in order to note any multi-collinearity issues that might exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Correlation plot of 61 lipid variables included in a second version of Model 4. With the exception of the unkwown identity lipids lip1172 and lip156 that were previously seen, the rest of the variables are mostly positively correlated but without exhibiting high correlations i.e. the maximum being close to 85% and with only 11 pairs out of the 1,953 ones having a correlation higher than 70%; note that the data matrix contains many zeroes which also contribute to the lack of high correlations. The lack of high correlations is indicative of a network characterized by low entropy or conditionally independent lipids.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all these lipids are added into a penalized ordinal regression model, spending about 9 degrees of freedom, the value added is non significant i.e. C-index becomes 0.8454 when in Model 4 it was 0.8402. In addition, the calibration plot indicates good calibration but severe overestimation of the predicted probabilities for both of the ordinal regression’s probability types. Hence Model 4 is not updated.",
